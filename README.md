NullBot
=======

NullBot - an adaptive Skirmish AI for Warzone 2100 open-source realtime strategy game is hosted here after being rewritten from scratch as "NullBot 3". Older versions of NullBot are still hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/nullbot2100/

Unlike NullBot 1.x or 2.x, NullBot 3.x doesn't have any build system; you can just throw the files in this repository to /multiplay/skirmish/, select the AI in the game menu and play and it'll work.

You can download a release of this AI that is considered to be "the most stable", and also discuss the AI and report bugs, in the official NullBot3 thread at http://forums.wz2100.net/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=10619

All releases are marked with git tags in this repository.

This AI requires Warzone 2100 v3.2 or higher to work. Unless a time machine has been invented, this means that you'd need to get a nightly development snapshot of the game's master version at http://buildbot.wz2100.net/files/ Please use the actually-latest snapshot, because a lot of work is currently being done on the scripting system.

Harold
=======
Harold is my take on expanding NullBot's interaction with human players, using Automated Personalites. By that, this means you, the player, will be given chat messages from this modfied NullBot, whether you are friend or foe. Although, haoNoQ made this impressive AI exist, not many players felt pressured to take on this AI and it's adaptive strategies. So, by giving this AI a more talkative aspect, the Player can engage in mind games with this AI. This, in theory, might result in more player victories over this AI, when the player successfully pressures the AI into making rash decisions.

The ultimate goal of Harold is to make Skirmishes against the AI, fun again. Any suggestions are allowed, but only if they are within scope of this experiment.
